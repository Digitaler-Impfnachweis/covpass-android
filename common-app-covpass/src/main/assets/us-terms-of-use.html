                    <p><u>LIMITATION OF DIRECT DAMAGES.</u> IN NO EVENT SHALL RKI’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR
                        DIRECT DAMAGES TO YOU UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR RELATED TO THE APP OR YOUR USE OF THE APP OR

                    <p><u>ARBITRATION.</u> If the you and RKI do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any
                        other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding individual
                        arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You are giving up the right to
                        litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or
                        jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a neutral arbitrator,
                        whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court with
                        jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</p>
                    <p><u>NO CLASS ACTION PROCEDURE.</u> Notwithstanding any of the foregoing or any other provision of
                        this Agreement, class arbitration is not permitted under any circumstance. You agree that you
                        MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST RKI ONLY IN YOUR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not as a plaintiff
                        or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, you agree that the
                        arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person’s claims, and may not
                        otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
                    <p><u>COURT TO DECIDE DISPUTES REGARDING NONAVAILABILITY OF CLASS ACTION PROCEDURE.</u> Although the
                        non-availability of any form of representative or class proceeding is clear under these terms of
                        use, should any dispute arise regarding or relating to the existence, validity, enforceability,
                        or interpretation of this paragraph, the federal court located in Santa Clara, California, shall
                        have the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the issue.</p>
                    <p><u>GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.</u> These terms of use shall be governed by and construed
                        under the law of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to conflict of laws principles
                        or the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any and all suits
                        hereunder shall be brought and resolved solely and exclusively in, and you and RKI hereby
                        irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and proper venue of, the state and federal
                        courts located in the County of Santa Clara, State of California, USA, and waive any objections
                        thereto based on any ground including improper venue or Forum Non-Conveniens.</p>
