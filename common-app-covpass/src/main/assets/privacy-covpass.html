            <h1>CovPass-App privacy notice</h1>
            <p>This privacy notice explains how your data is processed and what data protection rights you have when using the CovPass-App to manage certain certificates – digital COVID Certificates proving coronavirus vaccinations, negative
              coronavirus test results, or that you have recovered from a confirmed case of coronavirus.</p>
            <p>Please also note the data protection information that you receive when your digital COVID Certificate is issued (e.g. at a vaccination/testing centre, doctor’s surgery or pharmacy).</p>
            <p>This privacy notice covers the following topics:</p>

            <p>Do you have any questions about the CovPass-App? Answers to many common questions can be found on the RKI’s official CovPass website (<a href="https://www.digitaler-impfnachweis-app.de/faq" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">www.digitaler-impfnachweis-app.de/faq</a>).</p>
            <h2>1. Who is the CovPass-App published by?</h2>
            <p>This app is published by the Robert Koch Institute (<strong>RKI</strong>) for the German Federal Government. The RKI is also responsible for ensuring that your personal data is processed in compliance with data protection regulations.
            </p>
            <h2>2. What is the digital COVID Certificate?</h2>
            <p>The digital COVID Certificate is proof that a person has</p>
            <ul>
              <li>been vaccinated against COVID-19 (<strong>vaccination certificate</strong>),</li>
              <li>tested negative for COVID-19 (<strong>test certificate</strong>) or</li>
              <li>recovered from a COVID-19 infection (<strong>certificate of recovery</strong>).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Digital COVID Certificates are valid within the entire European Union (EU) from 1 July 2021 as certification of COVID-19 vaccination and testing, and of recovery from a confirmed case of COVID-19. The official name is “EU Digital COVID
              Certificate” (<strong>certificate</strong>).</p>
            <p>A certificate can be obtained on request from a competent entity (vaccination centres, testing points, doctor’s surgeries or pharmacies) after a vaccination, a test or after recovering from a confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>
            <p>You can carry the certificate in paper form or in electronic form on your smartphone. Each certificate contains a QR code with an electronic signature from the RKI to protect against forgeries. If you would like to store a certificate
              on your smartphone, you can simply scan the QR code with the CovPass app. The app then securely stores an electronic version of the certificate on your smartphone.</p>
            <p>More information about how the certificate works is available on the following websites:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.digitaler-impfnachweis-app.de/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.digitaler-impfnachweis-app.de/faq</a> (provider: RKI)</li>
              <li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en" target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en</a> (provider: EU Comission)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that the QR codes on the certificates contain health data (data about coronavirus vaccinations, coronavirus test results or your recovery from a confirmed case of coronavirus). You should only show the certificates and QR
              codes if you want to provide appropriate proof. Do not provide QR codes to anyone if you do not want the data to be read. To prevent unwanted access to the certificates stored on your smartphone, you should set up a code lock on the
              device.</p>
            <h2>3. Is using the app voluntary?</h2>
            <p>Yes, using the app is voluntary. Each certificate can also be used in paper form as proof of vaccination, a test result or recovery. You will not suffer any disadvantages, because the paper version and the electronic version of the
              certificate are equivalent. You can decide at any time whether you want to scan the QR code and store the certificate in the app. You can also delete the certificate from the app at any time.</p>
            <h2>4. Why is your data processed?</h2>
            <p>The RKI briefly processes the necessary personal data of certificate holders to technically create and sign the requested certificate (Sect. 22(5)–(7) of the Infection Protection Act, IfSG). The personal data is deleted at the RKI
              immediately once the technical creation of the certificate is complete. There is no centrally administered registry of vaccinations or certificates.</p>
            <p>You can use the CovPass-App to scan your own printed certificates and those of family members and store them in encrypted form on your smartphone.</p>
            <p>In order to prove to third parties – in the situations where this is required by law – that you have been vaccinated, have tested negative, or have recovered from COVID-19, you can show the relevant certificate to the person performing
              the check. If the person performing the check uses a special verification app (such as the RKI’s CovPassCheck-App), it is sufficient to show the QR code of the certificate and have it scanned. To do this, tap the “Show current QR code”
              button. This will display the QR code, name, date of birth and the type of certificate. In addition, you can select a special view in the app in which only the isolated QR code is displayed without the other information (to do this, tap
              the “Show QR code” button when viewing a certificate in full). The QR code is the certificate in digital form and contains only the information necessary for the specific type of certificate (see Section 5).</p>
            <p>The verification app allows for example authorities, travel companies and other service providers in the EU to scan the QR code of the certificate presented to them, in order to check its validity. During the verification, the data
              contained in the certificate is read. The verification app will show whether the certificate provided is valid. If the certificate is valid, the name and date of birth of the certificate holder will also be disclosed, as will whether or
              not it is a test certificate. In the case of test certificates, the time of sampling will also be displayed.</p>
            <p>The name and date of birth of the certificate holder are displayed so that the person performing the check can compare this information with an ID document (e.g. passport or ID card). A notification of whether the certificate is a test
              certificate, and the time of sampling, are necessary to enable the person performing the check to assess whether the test result on which the certificate is based is still valid.</p>
            <p>To protect against forged certificates, it is necessary to verify the authenticity of the stored certificates. The electronic signature contained in a certificate’s QR code is used for this purpose. The electronic signature is
              generated by the RKI when creating the certificate, on the basis of the data contained in the certificate (see Section 5). The signature is a special type of encryption that allows the RKI to confirm that the certificate is an official
              digital document created by the RKI.</p>
            <p>The RKI also provides the corresponding public keys from the RKI. These public keys can be used to check whether a certificate’s electronic signature actually originates from the RKI and whether the certificate has been manipulated
              since being signed electronically.</p>
            <p>The CovPass-App regularly downloads the RKI’s public keys in the background and stores them locally on your smartphone. This allows the app to regularly check the validity of the electronic signature and thus the authenticity of the
              stored certificates. The public keys do not contain any personal data.</p>
            <p>You can use the app to check whether the certificates stored in the app are valid. EU countries may adopt their own rules for the validity of certificates. For example, test certificates may be valid for a longer period in some EU
              countries than in others. The EU countries exchange these rules via a common exchange server. Before starting a trip, you can therefore use the app to check whether your certificates are valid in the destination country.</p>
            <p>If you want to check whether a certificate is valid, your app downloads the current rules of all Member States from the app’s server system. The app then uses the data contained in a certificate to check whether that certificate
              complies with the rules before showing you the corresponding result. The verification takes place exclusively offline in the app and no data is passed on here to the RKI or other recipients (other health authorities in Germany or other
              countries and other third parties).</p>
            <p>Please note that entry rules are subject to change and additional rules may apply both in the destination country and when you return. Guidance on entry requirements can also be found on this EU website: <a
                href="https://reopen.europa.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://reopen.europa.eu/en</a></p>
            <p>In addition, the app can remind you to check stored vaccination certificates if you received your last vaccination a long time ago. To do this, the app downloads the current rules on booster vaccination recommendations from the app’s
              server system at regular intervals. The app then uses the data contained in the certificates to check whether a booster vaccination is recommended soon. This check also takes place exclusively offline in the app and no data about the
              vaccination is passed on to the RKI.</p>
            <h2>5. What data is processed?</h2>
            <h3>a. Certificate data</h3>
            <p>The certificates contain health data and are stored in a secure area on your smartphone. The certificates contain the following data:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data about the certificate holder (last name, first name, date of birth),</li>
              <li>type of certificate (vaccination certificate, test certificate, certificate of recovery),</li>
              <li>the necessary information about the vaccination, the test or the recovery. You can find out what this information is in detail from the information provided on the certificate (in German and English). No information other than that
                contained on the certificate is stored,</li>
              <li>the RKI’s electronic signature and</li>
              <li>a QR code containing the aforementioned data in encoded form.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data will be stored in the app as soon as you scan the QR code on the printed certificate. This data was collected previously by the entity that issued the certificate, and transmitted to the RKI so that the certificate could be
              signed.</p>
            <h3>b. Access data</h3>
            <p>In order to download the RKI’s public key for authenticating the electronic signature, or the current rules of the Member States on the validity of certificates and the rules on booster vaccination recommendations, a connection needs
              to be established to an RKI server. The server has to process technical access data for this purpose. This data includes the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>IP address</li>
              <li>Date and time of retrieval</li>
              <li>Transmitted data volume (or packet length)</li>
              <li>Notification of whether the data exchange was a success.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This access data is processed to enable and secure the connection and data exchange between the app and the server. You will not be identified personally as a user of the app and no user profile will be created. Your IP address will
              not be stored beyond the end of the individual usage procedure.</p>
            <h2>6. On what legal basis is your data processed?</h2>
            <p>When creating the certificate, the RKI has a legal basis for processing the certificate data mentioned in Section 5 a. That legal basis is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(c), Art. 9(2)(g) of the General Data Protection Regulation
              (<strong>GDPR</strong>) in conjunction with</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sect. 22(5) IfSG (vaccination certificate),</li>
              <li>Sect. 22(6) IfSG (certificate of recovery) or</li>
              <li>Sect. 22(7) IfSG (test certificate).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The EU is currently working on a European legal basis for the certificate, which will uniformly regulate the data processing required for creating and electronically signing certificates for all EU countries. The RKI reserves the right
              to carry out data processing in the future on the basis of this regulation.</p>
            <p>The legal basis for the processing of the access data mentioned above in Section 5 b. is Sect. 3 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(e) GDPR.</p>
            <h2>7. What permissions does the app require?</h2>
            <p>The CovPass-App requires access to your smartphone camera when you scan the QR code to add a certificate in the app. The app also requires an internet connection in order to download the latest key information from the RKI server
              system. For information about other permissions the app may request, please refer to the FAQ section in the app.</p>
            <h2>8. When will your data be deleted?</h2>
            <p>The certificates will only be stored in the app on your smartphone. The certificates are not automatically deleted in your app. If you wish to delete a certificate, you can remove a certificate from the app yourself at any time or
              delete the app. To add the certificate again later, you will need to rescan the QR code of the printed certificate.</p>
            <p>The RKI does not permanently store any personal data relating to the certificates on the server system. Immediately after the signed certificate has been provided to the issuing entity, the data is permanently deleted at the RKI.</p>
            <h2>9. Who will receive your personal data?</h2>
            <p>The RKI has commissioned the company KDO Service GmbH (KDO) to operate and maintain the server system. KDO processes the personal data on behalf and at the instruction of the RKI (meaning it is what’s known as a processor under data
              protection law). Contractual safeguards are in place to ensure that the data protection requirements are met.</p>
            <p>If, in the situations where it is required by law, you present a certificate to other persons or entities (for example, European border authorities or service providers), they will become aware of all the data contained in the
              certificate.</p>
            <p>You can prevent this by only having the QR code displayed in the app, so that it can be scanned using a verification app. Then, the data contained in the QR code will be read. Here the verification app will only show whether the
              certificate shown is valid, together with an explanation of the result. In the case of a valid certificate, the name and date of birth of the certificate holder are displayed additionally in the verification app, so that the person
              performing the check can compare this information with an ID document (e.g. passport or ID card). In addition, it is displayed whether the certificate is a test certificate or not. In the case of test certificates, the time of sampling
              is then also displayed so that the person performing the check can assess whether the underlying test result is still valid.</p>
            <p>The verification app will only process the displayed data for a short time. Once the verification is complete, the displayed data is discarded, meaning the data that has been read is not permanently stored.</p>
            <h2>10. What rights do you have under data protection law?</h2>
            <p>If the RKI processes your personal data, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The rights under Art. 15, 16, 17, 18 and 21 GDPR,</li>
              <li>the right to contact the official RKI Data Protection Officer and raise your concerns (Art. 38(4) GDPR) and</li>
              <li>the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority. To do so, you can for example contact your local supervisory authority or the authority responsible for the RKI. The supervisory authority responsible for
                the RKI is the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Graurheindorfer Straße 153, 53117 Bonn.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that the RKI can only fulfil the rights mentioned above if data to which the asserted claims relate is processed on an ongoing basis. This would only be possible if personal data were stored after being transmitted to the
              RKI server. This is not necessary for the purposes of the app. For this reason, the aforementioned data protection rights under Art. 15, 16, 17, 18 and 21 GDPR are largely redundant.</p>
            <h2>11. Data protection officer and contact</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding data protection in connection with the CovPass-App, you are welcome to send them to the RKI’s official data protection officer by post to: Robert Koch-Institut, FAO the data protection
              officer, Nordufer 20, 13353 Berlin, or by emailing <a href="mailto:datenschutz@rki.de">datenschutz@rki.de</a>.</p>
