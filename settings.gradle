// How to include locally cloned repos / composing builds:
// Create a settings-local.gradle file and add entries like this to it:
//
// substituteAllModules '../path-to-other-repo'
//
// Note that settings-local.gradle is ignored by Git, so you can't mistakenly commit it and you can adjust the paths
// to your local setup without any conflicts with other people.
