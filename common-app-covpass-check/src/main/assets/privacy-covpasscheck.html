            <h1>CovPassCheck app privacy notice</h1>
            <p>This privacy notice explains how your data is processed and what data protection rights you have when you use the CovPassCheck app to verify digital COVID Certificates.</p>
            <p>Digital COVID Certificates have been valid within the entire European Union (EU) since 1 July 2021 as certification of COVID-19 vaccination and testing, and of recovery from a confirmed case of COVID-19. The official name is “EU Digital COVID Certificate” (<strong>certificate</strong>).</p>
            <p>This privacy notice covers the following topics:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Who is the CovPassCheck app published by?</li>
              <li>Is using the app voluntary?</li>
              <li>Why is your data processed?</li>
              <li>What data is processed?</li>
              <li>On what legal basis is your data processed?</li>
              <li>What permissions does the app require?</li>
              <li>When will your data be deleted?</li>
              <li>Who will receive your data?</li>
              <li>What rights do you have under data protection law?</li>
              <li>Data protection officer and contact</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>1. Who is the CovPassCheck app published by?</h2>
            <p>This app is published by the Robert Koch Institute (<strong>RKI</strong>) for the German Federal Government. The RKI is also responsible for ensuring that your personal data is processed in compliance with data protection regulations.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Is using the app voluntary?</h2>
            <p>Using the app is voluntary. It is entirely up to you whether you install and use the app to verify the validity of certificates. There are other acceptable ways to check vaccination, test, or recovery certificates.</p>
            <h2>3. Why is your data processed?</h2>
            <p>The app allows you to verify whether other people’s certificates are valid.</p>
            <p>To do this, you can use the CovPassCheck app to scan the QR code displayed on a certificate presented to you, in order to ascertain whether that certificate is valid. The QR code contains an electronic signature of the national issuer (in Germany, the issuer is the RKI). The electronic signature is generated by the RKI when creating the certificate, on the basis of the data about the certificate holder which is contained in the certificate. The signature is a special type of encryption that allows the RKI to confirm that the certificate is an official digital document created by the RKI.</p>
            <p>The RKI also provides the corresponding public keys from the RKI. These public keys can be used to check whether a certificate’s electronic signature actually originates from the RKI and whether the certificate has been manipulated since being signed electronically.</p>
            <p>The CovPassCheck app regularly downloads the RKI’s public keys in the background and stores them locally on your smartphone. This allows the app to regularly check the validity of the electronic signature and thus the authenticity of the stored certificates. The public keys do not contain any personal data.</p>
            <p>EU countries may now adopt their own rules for the validity of certificates. For example, test certificates may be valid for a longer period in some EU countries than in others. The EU countries exchange these rules via a common exchange server. The CovPassCheck app regularly downloads the latest rules of all Member States from the app’s server system.</p>
            <p>The verification takes place exclusively offline in the app and no data is passed on here to the RKI or other recipients (other health authorities in Germany or other countries and other third parties).</p>
            <p>Please note that you are only authorised to have someone else present their certificate for verification to the extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p>If you scan a certificate and read data in the process, you are responsible for compliance with data protection regulations.</p>
            <h2>4. What data is processed?</h2>
            <p>In order to download the public keys for authenticating the electronic signature and the current rules on the validity of certificates, a connection regularly needs to be established to an RKI server. The server has to process technical access data for this purpose. This data includes the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>IP address</li>
              <li>Date and time of retrieval</li>
              <li>Transmitted data volume (or packet length)</li>
              <li>Notification of whether the data exchange was a success.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This access data is processed to enable and secure the connection and data exchange between the app and the server. You will not be identified personally as a user of the CovPassCheck app and no user profile will be created. Your IP address will not be stored beyond the end of the individual usage procedure.</p>
            <h2>5. On what legal basis is your data processed?</h2>
            <p>The RKI will only process your data if it has a legal basis for doing so. The processing of your access data as described in this privacy notice is necessary to technically implement the confirmation of the validity of the certificates. The legal basis for the processing of your access data is Sect. 3 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
            <h2>6. What permissions does the app require?</h2>
            <p>The CovPassCheck app requires access to your smartphone camera when you scan the QR code to add a certificate in the app. The app also requires an internet connection in order to download the latest key information from the RKI server
              system. For information about other permissions the app may request, please refer to the FAQ section in the app.</p>
            <h2>7. When will your data be deleted?</h2>
            <p>The app will not permanently store the QR codes scanned by you, or the information read from them, on your smartphone. Nor will the RKI permanently store any personal data on the app’s server system.</p>
            <h2>8. Who will receive your data?</h2>
            <p>The RKI has commissioned the company KDO Service GmbH (KDO) to operate and maintain the server system. KDO processes the personal data on behalf and at the instruction of the RKI (meaning it is what’s known as a processor under data protection law). Contractual safeguards are in place to ensure that the data protection requirements are met.</p>
            <h2>9. What rights do you have under data protection law?</h2>
            <p>If the RKI processes your personal data, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The rights under Art. 15, 16, 17, 18 and 21 GDPR,</li>
              <li>the right to contact the official RKI Data Protection Officer and raise your concerns (Art. 38(4) GDPR) and</li>
              <li>the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority. To do so, you can for example contact your local supervisory authority or the authority responsible for the RKI. The supervisory authority responsible for
                the RKI is the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Graurheindorfer Straße 153, 53117 Bonn.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that the RKI can only fulfil the rights mentioned above if data to which the asserted claims relate is processed on an ongoing basis. This would only be possible if personal data were stored after being transmitted to the
              RKI server. This is not necessary for the purposes of the app. For this reason, the aforementioned data protection rights under Art. 15, 16, 17, 18 and 21 GDPR are largely redundant.</p>
            <h2>10. Data protection officer and contact</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding data protection in connection with the CovPassCheck app, you are welcome to send them to the RKI’s official data protection officer by post to: Robert Koch-Institut, FAO the data protection
              officer, Nordufer 20, 13353 Berlin, or by emailing <a href="mailto:datenschutz@rki.de">datenschutz@rki.de</a>.</p>
